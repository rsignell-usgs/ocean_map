    a = shrink(array, shape)
    
    array is an numpy ndarray, and shape is a tuple (e.g., from
    array.shape). a is the input array shrunk such that its maximum
    dimensions are given by shape. If shape has more dimensions than
    array, the last dimensions of shape are fit.
    
    as, bs = shrink(a, b)
    
    If the second argument is also an array, both a and b are shrunk to
    the dimensions of each other. The input arrays must have the same
    number of dimensions, and the resulting arrays will have the same
    shape.
    Example
    -------
    
    >>> shrink(rand(10, 10), (5, 9, 18)).shape
    (9, 10)
    >>> map(shape, shrink(rand(10, 10, 10), rand(5, 9, 18)))        
    [(5, 9, 10), (5, 9, 10)]
